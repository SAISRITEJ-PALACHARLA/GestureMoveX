# 🎮 GestureMoveX

> 🚀 "Why click a button when you can wave your hand or move your eyes?"

**GestureMoveX** is our capstone brainchild — a futuristic, hands-free, eyes-on game controller built with 💻 **Python + OpenCV + MediaPipe + GazeTracking**… and yep, it’s Dockerized too 🐳.

Built by a team of three caffeine-fueled developers on a mission to **redefine how humans interact with machines**.

## ✨ What Can You Do With GestureMoveX?

👋 **Wave your hand** to steer  
👁️ **Move your eyes** to switch tabs or scroll  
💥 Avoid obstacles like a pro — no keyboard needed  
🐳 Deploy the whole system in Docker because… why not?

> “We wanted to build something that feels like sci-fi but runs on your laptop.”
